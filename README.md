#  CICS 191: First Year Seminar -- Math Puzzles
1. ##### Favorite In-Class Puzzle: Monty Hall Problem
    You are on a gameshow. The host of the gameshow shows you three doors. A valuable prize is behind one of these three doors. After you choose one of the three doors, the host opens one of the two remaining doors. The host shows you that the prize is not behind the door he opened. He then gives you the option to switch your door to the other door. Should you switch?

2. ##### Favorite Out-Of-Class Puzzle: Doubling Lily Pads Riddle
    This is a very simple riddle, but I like it because of how simple it is. It goes like this: in a pond there is a lily pad. Each day, each lily pad in the pond doubles and creates another lily pad. By the 30th day the entire pond is covered by lily pads. On what day is the pond half-covered?
